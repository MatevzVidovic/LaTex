% to gre pa potem v tekst    \includegraphics{universe}

%The command \graphicspath{ {images/} } tells LaTeX that the images are kept in a %folder named images under the current directory.

%The \includegraphics{universe} command is the one that actually included the image %in the document. Here universe is the name of the file containing the image %without the extension, then universe.PNG becomes universe. The file name of the %image should not contain white spaces nor multiple dots. 
%Note: The file extension is allowed to be included, but it's a good idea to omit %it. If the file extension is omitted it will prompt LaTeX to search for all the %supported formats. It is also usually recommended to use lowercase letters for the %file extension when uploading image files.
